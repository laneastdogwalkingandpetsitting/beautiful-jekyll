## About me

My name is Rich Wilson and I have a 30 year long background of programming, system admin and web design. More recently I left full timer employment and joined my wife with her dog walking business. Between walking dogs, I still dabble in and around the IT field and having identified a niche in the market, decided to create websites for people who don't want to spend a fortune doing it.

Some interesting projects I have written from scratch:

- A web application for writing educational reports for students
- A P2P windows application (and service) for the deployment of software on a LAN with a focus on reducing network load.
- A cashless catering system integrating with biometric readers.
