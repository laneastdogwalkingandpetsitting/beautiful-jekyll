Want to add a more professional touch to your business communication with a custom email address (like I have [hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk](mailto:hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk))? Rather than using a gmail, yahoo, btinternet or outlook address, you can have an email address that matches your website address.

I can also set this up assuming I manage your domain name, making use of [Zoho workspace](https://www.zoho.com/workplace/). Zoho workspace offer (in their own words) a 'Forever Free Plan Up to five users, 5GB/User, 25MB attachment limit. Web access only. Email hosting for single domain.'.

What this means, is that you can have:

 - to 5 email addresses, eg hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, sales@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, support@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, etc
 - access to the emails via Zoho's website
 - 5Gb of space per user - more than enough to get you started
 - attachments of up to 25Mb per email
 - a single custom domain (probably fine for most people)
 
Note: If this turns out to be not enough for your requirements, you can upgrade to their 'standard' teir for £2.40 per user per month.

I can set this up for you at an estimated cost of £15.
