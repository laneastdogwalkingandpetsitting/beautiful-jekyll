## What about email?

Want to add a more professional touch to your communication with a *custom email address* (like I have [hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk](mailto:hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk))? Rather than using a gmail, yahoo, btinternet or outlook address, you can have an email address that matches your website address.

I can also set this up assuming I manage your domain name, making use of [Zoho workspace](https://www.zoho.com/workplace/) - Zoho workspace offer a free basic email service for up to 5 users. In their own words:

*'Forever Free Plan Up to five users, 5GB/User, 25MB attachment limit. Web access only. Email hosting for single domain.'.*

What this means, is that you can have:

- to 5 email addresses, eg hello@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, sales@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, support@nofrillswebsites.co.uk, etc
- access to the emails via Zoho's website
- 5Gb of space per user - more than enough to get you started
- attachments of up to 25Mb per email
- a single custom domain (probably fine for most people)
 
Note: If this turns out to be not enough for your requirements, you can upgrade to their 'standard' teir for £2.40 per user per month.

I can set this up for you at an estimated cost of £15 - it should take around an hour to setup.

A few things it's worth also mentioning:

- each email address comes with its own email account, so if you had fred@ email and a jane@, you'd need to login as fred to see those emails, but login as jane to see those. This is fine if you have 2 people logging in anyway, but if it's just you, switching between the two accounts to check emails can be a pain. You'd be better with a single account, which is why I just have hello@.
- On the free plan, it's not possible to setup a redirect rule to send emails to a differnt email address.
