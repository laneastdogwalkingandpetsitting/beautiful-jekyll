### Payment for creating websites
I ask for 50% of the estimated costs upfront. Once the site is finished[^1], I'll let you know how long it took and invoice you for the final cost. Once I receive this I'll then publish the site. If full payment is not received, I reserve the right to make the website unavailable until full payment is received. 

### Estimates
Estimates are based on the information provided, are not legally binding and are subject to change. The final price may vary depending on additional services required to complete the work.
It may be that the amount of work needed to create the website exceeds the estimate I have given. If this happens I will contact you to inform you how much extra time I estimate is needed.

If extra content is sent to me to be added, it is likely that I will need to charge extra for the additional content to be added.

### Domains and domain names
#### Transfers
If you decide you would like to transfer your domain to a different domain registrar, let me know and I'm happy to do this free of charge. Once transferred however it is up to you to ensure it is correctly configured.

#### Renewals
Every year your website domain will need to be renewed. Prior to renewal, I will invoice you for the renewal cost. If you do not pay the invoice your domain will lapse and eventually will cease to function and you may lose the domain altogether.

#### Use of your own domain
As I have no control of the configuration of your domain, I cannot be held responsible if your website is not accessible due to incorrect configuration of the domain with your domain registrar.

#### Availability of websites / uptime
I can accept no liability if your website becomes unavailable. Your website will be hosted with a free hosting provider and there is no guarantee of uptime or availability. The service I provide is to create a website and make it available at a minimal cost. Since I started creating websites this way, however, I've not had any problems.

### Website transfers
If you would like to take your website elsewhere, I can zip up the files that make your website and email them to you. At this point, you'll likely also want to take your domain away too - see domain transfer section.
