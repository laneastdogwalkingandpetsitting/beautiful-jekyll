After a website, but don't want to pay the earth for it?

If you want a simple website without the hassle of learning how to make them yourself or paying someone else a fortune for one, you've come to the right place.

The websites I make look kind of similar to this one (however different *[themes](/themes/)* are available, giving a different look and feel) and all you pay is:

- the domain name (assuming you haven't got one already) generally costing around £5 - £25 per year.
- my time to make it at a flat rate of £15 per hour.
- any changes later on - let me know what changes you need and I'll update it at again just £15 per hour.

<div style="float: left; text-align:center; border-style: solid; margin:10px">
    <a href="https://www.romacoon.com" target="_black"><img src="assets/img/romacoon20pc.png" alt="An example website of mine"/></a>
    <br/>
    <em>An example website that I made</em>
</div>

There are no monthly hosting fees, no hidden costs, just the yearly domain and my time creating the website and updating it, as per your requirements.

How long will it take me to create your website? It of course varies depending how much content you need - as an example this website took me about 3 - 4 hours to create[^1], once I'd thought up the wording of what I needed to say. So, this website would cost circa, £60 plus domain name (£5.41) and an extra £15 as I setup email too, so £80.41. After that just the domain renewal, which can vary a little.
